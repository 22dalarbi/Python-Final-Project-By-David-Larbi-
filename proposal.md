# Proposal
 
## What will (likely) be the title of your project?
 
Septa Regional Rail App for Tidbyt
 
## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")
 
It is an application for an electronic light display called tidbyt, using the septa API the app displays the which line and the next time it reaches your desired train stop.
 
## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
 
Hopefully, the final product will be able to allow the user to choose the line and the station. I don't have a physical tidbyt so I can't test the inputs, but I can put them in myself. It will be executed by programming with Starlank, a python based language.
 
## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?
 
TODO, if applicable
 
## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.
 
TODO, if applicable
 
## In the world of software, almost everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.
 
### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?
 
I will accomplish at least learning the language and getting the API working. It sounds simple but my experience with APIs is limited and Starlank is very confusing and there are not many tutorials online.
 
### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?
 
The better outcome is making the app work, I think I can get the API working. But organizing it on screen and making it look cool is a gamble.
 
### In a sentence (or list of features), define the BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?
 
The best outcome is the app fully working and I'm able to upload it to the app network. Knowing that the official people are working on one app that incorporates train lines all over the world. That would be cool for people to use my app, mainly because people have asked in the forums.
 
## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?
 
I need to learn how to program Starlank, and also be able to install things from source on windows. Which is much more difficult than on Linux, a lot more. I need to do a lot of research with Starlank, mainly because it has a lot of different things.
