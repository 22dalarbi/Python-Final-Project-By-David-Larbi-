Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have been able to download the the tidbyt dev app form source on my laptop, there tutuorial is very hard to follow. I have also been able to mostly learn Starlank. though i don't think I have fully masteered it. I have also designed on paper what the app will look like and what it will do.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

Gotten the Septa API to work and started actually building the app.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

The learning curve is very steep and in reality, python has not really helped me understand Starlank at all. But we move.
