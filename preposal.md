# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

There is this product called Tidbyt (https://tidbyt.com/), it is a retro-style display that can show apps that you load through it phone the Tidbyt app on your phone. It is a LED pixel display, in the shape of a rectangle, and is about as big as an alarm clock. You can make your own apps using the programming language Starlark, which is a python based language used for configuration. Sorry for the long explanation. Basically, I want to make a septa app to show train times, people have already created apps for trains but not for Septa. Mainly because the product is based in NY. I have experience with API's,  but a lot of them are different, so this could be kind of easy or super stressful. Also, I am going to make the app look good and not just a plain Transportation app like the rest of them.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I plan to go solo.

## Do you have any questions of your own?

No, I just want to know if my preproposal is valid.
