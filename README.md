# Python-Final-Project-Preposal-By-David-Larbi-
A Tidbyt app for Septa Train Services


For the septa_with_json.star

This star file uses the json file without grabbing from API, its just so I could test if it worked and also test other things like changing colors, etc. Which I will be doing in the future.


For the septa_with_api.star

This is the file with the working API, it is set to the Langhorne Station, which is what I use. I got the "Next to Arrive API" form: 
https://www3.septa.org/#/

This is what an example of what it would look like at 9:32 PM showing the next train at 10:12PM, and its "On Time"

As you can see it doesn't look so good, this is mainy becuase I spent a lot of the time learing how API's work, and how to code in Starlank. There are not a lot of tutorials online, so I had to use other apps to learn. I also had some help fomrt the devolpers of the company in there discord, they were very helpful. I plan on doing a cool thing this summer that requires me to understand API's so this is very helpful to me.
